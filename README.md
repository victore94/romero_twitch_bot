I love gaming, I've been gaming for years now; my entire life. From those days where I had a Gameboy pocket (That never fit in my pocket by the way). Sega Genesis, the first Playstation, then the second then the third then the fourth, Nintendo consoles and portable devices, PC. Really anything that ran on electricity and had buttons (and sometimes games that used no buttons), games have always held a special place in my heart. So when I got into web development I knew I wanted to make something that could combine my passion for gaming and my passion for programming into one fun passion project.
